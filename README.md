# shopping
This program is implementation of online shopping in C programming language.
Since this is in C, the entire code is relatively easy to understand. 
This was the very first programming assignment that I had and I enjoyed coding each and every detail in this program.
There is room for improvement in terms of the online shopping products data storage.
Hope you guys find this program useful and easy to understand.
